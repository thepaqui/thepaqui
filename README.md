## About me

Hello! I am Th√©o, a 22 year-old French computer science student.  
I've been a student at 42 Nice since November 7th 2022.  
I'm currently learning how to deploy a modern and interactive website using PostgresSQL, Django, Next.js, Bootstrap and Docker.  

I'm interested in art, music and video games.  
I aspire to work in video game design and development one day.
